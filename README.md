# custom-xcode-templates
Custom XCode file templates to help generate boilerplate code and ensure consistent code patterns

This was developed with the help of the following:
* ["Xcode Project and File Templates" from RayWenderlich.com](https://www.raywenderlich.com/26582967-xcode-project-and-file-templates)
* ["A step-by-step guide to create a custom Xcode template" by Ioannis Diamantidis](https://diamantidis.github.io/2019/07/21/xcode-custom-templates)
* ["Xcode New File Templates" by Andy Ibanez](https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/xcode-new-file-templates/)
* ["XCode Templates tutorial – How to create custom template step by step" from itCraft](https://itcraftapps.com/blog/xcode-templates-tutorial/)

It also used the [VIPER Module Generator by Kaakati on GitHub](https://github.com/Kaakati/VIPER-Module-Generator) for inspiriation.
